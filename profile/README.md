Where open-source legends stay alive.

## 🌍 Mission

Many once-great open-source projects shaped the way we build software, but they were abandoned when their creators moved on, lacked time, or couldn’t sustain the effort.

https://notdead.dev exists to:

* **Preserve**: Keep historic open-source projects accessible in a curated home.
* **Maintain**: Use AI (Codex, Copilot, etc.) to handle basic upkeep: dependency updates, build fixes, linting, and minimal modernization.
* **Support**: Provide compatibility patches for teams still relying on these frameworks.
* **Educate**: Let developers explore and learn from the software that built the web we know today.

## 🛠️ How it works

* Each project lives in its own repository under this organization.
* An AI maintenance bot runs scheduled tasks to:
    * Update dependencies
    * Fix builds/tests
    * Apply lint and minor modernization
* Pull Requests are created automatically, with humans only stepping in for reviews and big-picture decisions.
* The goal is **compatibility, not innovation**: projects remain faithful to their original spirit.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome help!
